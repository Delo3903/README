Hello i'm Ramiro De Lorenzo, i'm a 22 year old male from Argentina and i'm trying to introduce myself in the IT working world
  personally i'm someone that loves a tidy and organized workplace, from the mental to the physical side, 
  i like to have colleagues that have the same enthusiasm as me to get the work done as well as possible.
  i tend to learn really quickly about the areas that im interested or need to know.
  mostly in try to have a direct communication with my coworkers since it makes the job easier.
  at the moment i'm working on a personal project selling 3D printed designs.
  
  i'm interested in:
      Computer Hardware;
      Software development (mostly inclined to an AGILE style);
      Videogame development;
      3D modeling;
      Languages.
      
  i'm learning:
      C++;
      Python;
      JavaScript;
      Finnish (language);
      3D modeling (Fusion 360 and blender).
      
  i'm looking forwards to work in a group that has a good attitude towards each individual and promotes personal and professional growth.
  aside from that i'm planning to move from Argentina to Finland
